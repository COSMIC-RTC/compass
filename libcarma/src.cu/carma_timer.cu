//  COMPASS: End-to-end AO simulation tool using GPU acceleration
//  The COMPASS platform was designed to meet the need of high-performance for the simulation of AO systems.
//
//  The final product includes a software package for simulating all the critical subcomponents of AO,
//  particularly in the context of the ELT and a real-time core based on several control approaches,
//  with performances consistent with its integration into an instrument. Taking advantage of the specific
//  hardware architecture of the GPU, the COMPASS tool allows to achieve adequate execution speeds to
//  conduct large simulation campaigns called to the ELT.
//
//  The COMPASS platform can be used to carry a wide variety of simulations to both testspecific components
//  of AO of the E-ELT (such as wavefront analysis device with a pyramid or elongated Laser star), and
//  various systems configurations such as multi-conjugate AO.
